                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>Our service allows users to submit epub files for processing. The processing may include various reading enhancement features, as well as additional features that we may introduce in the future. We are committed to enhancing the reading experience for our users and will continue to explore new ways to achieve this goal.</p>
                    <p>We only process non-DRM protected epub files, so unfortunately, we can't help you read your collection of illegally downloaded books. Think of us as your personal reading coach, minus the whistle and sweatband.</p>

                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>The user is responsible for ensuring that they have the legal right to submit the epub file to our service. If you're not sure if you have the right to submit a particular book, please consult your lawyer or psychic for guidance. We trust that you won't submit your ex's tell-all memoir or the secret recipe for Colonel Sanders' fried chicken.</p>

                    <p>We take data privacy seriously and do not keep any user data or use cookies. However, we may need to collect some data to operate the service, such as troubleshooting and monitoring performance. Rest assured, we won't use this data to spy on you or steal your identity, nor are we secretly collecting your browsing history or online shopping habits (although we do recommend you splurge on a new book every once in a while).</p>

                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>While processing documents, our service may need to submit parts or the entirety of the submitted documents to external services. These services may include our trusted friends like machine learning models, language translation services, or even some AI friends that we just met. We promise to make sure they don't tell any embarrassing secrets about you!</p>
                    <p>We take great care to ensure the security and privacy of any data transmitted to external services, and we will only do so when necessary for the proper functioning of our service. We do not retain any data submitted to external services beyond what is necessary for the processing of the documents. By using our service, you acknowledge and consent to the transmission of your data to external services in accordance with this clause.</p>

                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>We use reasonable measures to protect user data, but we're not quite as secure as Fort Knox. So, if you have any state secrets or confidential information to protect, it's probably best to keep it offline. We can't promise that our servers are protected by an impenetrable fortress guarded by dragons. Please don't hack us, we bruise easily.</p>

                    <p>We're not responsible for any damages or losses that may result from the use of our service, unless of course, our service inadvertently causes you to develop an unhealthy addiction to reading. In that case, we'll be happy to provide you with a list of local book clubs to help feed your habit.</p>

                    <p>We reserve the right to update or modify these terms of service at any time. Don't worry, we won't suddenly start requiring you to read books upside down or in Pig Latin (although that would be pretty impressive).</p>

Any disputes arising under or related to these terms of service shall be resolved exclusively by a dance-off. In the unlikely event of a legal dispute, we suggest we settle it the old-fashioned way: with a good, old-fashioned thumb war.</p>
                    <p>These terms of service are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the European Union. Any disputes arising out of or related to these terms will be resolved in accordance with the EU's legal system.

                    <p>We strive to keep our service up and running at all times, but sometimes even the most well-behaved servers need a break. We'll do our best to notify you of any scheduled maintenance or service interruptions, but we can't promise that we'll always be available.</p>
                    <p>In the event of an unexpected outage, we suggest taking a break from the internet and diving into a good book instead. It's a win-win for your eyes and your imagination.</p>

                    <p>We love hearing from our users! If you have any feedback or suggestions for how we can improve our service, we'd be happy to hear it. Just don't suggest that we stop encouraging people to read. That's like asking a fish to stop swimming - it just doesn't make sense.</p>
