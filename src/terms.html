        <h1 class="white fs-l3 fw-900 lh-1">Fast-Track Your Reading with Intellireading: Terms of Service</h1><br>
        <h2 class="white fw-600 fs-m3 mb-5">Service Description</h2>
        <h3 class="indigo-lightest fw-600 fs-m1 opacity-50 my-5">
        <p>Our service allows the user to submit an epub for processing. The processing may include various features, such as metaguiding, as well as additional features that we may introduce in the future. We are committed to enhancing the reading experience for our users and will continue to explore new ways to achieve this goal.</p>
        <p>We only process non-DRM protected epub files, so unfortunately, we can't help you read your collection of illegally downloaded books. Think of us as your personal reading coach, minus the whistle and sweatband.</p>
        </h3>
        <h2 class="white fw-600 fs-m3 mb-5">User Responsibilities</h2>
        <h3 class="indigo-lightest fw-600 fs-m1 opacity-50 my-5">
        <p>
            The user is responsible for ensuring that they have the legal right to submit the epub file to our service. If you're not sure if you have the right to submit a particular book, please consult your lawyer or psychic for guidance. We trust that you won't submit your ex's tell-all memoir or the secret recipe for Colonel Sanders' fried chicken.
        </p>
        </h3>
        <h2 class="white fw-600 fs-m3 mb-5">Data Collection and Use</h2>
<h3 class="indigo-lightest fw-600 fs-m1 opacity-50 my-5">
    <p>We take data privacy seriously and do not keep any user data or use cookies. However, we may need to collect some data to operate the service, such as troubleshooting and monitoring performance. Rest assured, we won't use this data to spy on you or steal your identity, neither we're secretly collecting your browsing history or online shopping habits (although we do recommend you splurge on a new book every once in a while).</p>
</h3>
<h2 class="white fw-600 fs-m3 mb-5">Use of Third-Party Services for Processing</h2>
<h3 class="indigo-lightest fw-600 fs-m1 opacity-50 my-5">
<p>While processing documents, our service may need to submit parts or the entirety of the submitted documents to external services. These services may include our trusted friends like machine learning models, language translation services, or even some AI friends that we just met. We promise to make sure they don't tell any embarrassing secrets about you!</p>
<p>We take great care to ensure the security and privacy of any data transmitted to external services, and we will only do so when necessary for the proper functioning of our service. We do not retain any data submitted to external services beyond what is necessary for the processing of the documents. By using our service, you acknowledge and consent to the transmission of your data to external services in accordance with this clause.</p>
</h3>
<h2 class="white fw-600 fs-m3 mb-5">Data Security</h2>
<h3 class="indigo-lightest fw-600 fs-m1 opacity-50 my-5">
<p>We use reasonable measures to protect user data, but we're not quite as secure as Fort Knox. So, if you have any state secrets or confidential information to protect, it's probably best to keep it offline. We can't promise that our servers are protected by an impenetrable fortress guarded by dragons. Please don't hack us, we bruise easily.</p>
</h3>
<h2 class="white fw-600 fs-m3 mb-5">Limitation of Liability</h2>
<h3 class="indigo-lightest fw-600 fs-m1 opacity-50 my-5">
<p>We're not responsible for any damages or losses that may result from the use of our service, unless of course, our service inadvertently causes you to develop an unhealthy addiction to reading. In that case, we'll be happy to provide you with a list of local book clubs to help feed your habit.</p>
</h3>
<h2 class="white fw-600 fs-m3 mb-5">Changes to Terms of Service</h2>
<h3 class="indigo-lightest fw-600 fs-m1 opacity-50 my-5">
<p>We reserve the right to update or modify these terms of service at any time. Don't worry, we won't suddenly start requiring you to read books upside down or in Pig Latin (although that would be pretty impressive).</p>
</h3>

<h2 class="white fw-600 fs-m3 mb-5">Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h2>
<h3 class="indigo-lightest fw-600 fs-m1 opacity-50 my-5">
    <p>These terms of service shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of European Union, without regard to its conflicts of law provisions. Any disputes arising under or related to these terms of service shall be resolved exclusively by a dance-off. In the unlikely event of a legal dispute, we suggest we settle it the old-fashioned way: with a good, old-fashioned thumb war.</p>
    <p>These terms of service are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the European Union. Any disputes arising out of or related to these terms will be resolved in accordance with the EU's legal system. We hope it never comes to that, but if it does, we'll be sure to brush up on our legal jargon.</p>
</h3>

<h2 class="white fw-600 fs-m3 mb-5">Intellectual Property</h2>
        <h3 class="indigo-lightest fw-600 fs-m1 opacity-50 my-5">
        <p>We respect the intellectual property rights of others and expect our users to do the same. Please don't submit content that you don't have the rights to, such as copyrighted material or someone else's unpublished work.</p>
        <p>We won't hesitate to turn into literary superheroes to protect the rights of authors everywhere.</p>
        </h3>

        <h2 class="white fw-600 fs-m3 mb-5">Service Interruptions</h2>
        <h3 class="indigo-lightest fw-600 fs-m1 opacity-50 my-5">
        <p>We strive to keep our service up and running at all times, but sometimes even the most well-behaved servers need a break. We'll do our best to notify you of any scheduled maintenance or service interruptions, but we can't promise that we'll always be available. </p>
        <p>In the event of an unexpected outage, we suggest taking a break from the internet and diving into a good book instead. It's a win-win for your eyes and your imagination.</p>
        </h3>

    <h2 class="white fw-600 fs-m3 mb-5">User Conduct</h2>
    <h3 class="indigo-lightest fw-600 fs-m1 opacity-50 my-5">
    <p>We expect all users to behave appropriately and respectfully while using our service. This includes refraining from submitting content that is defamatory, discriminatory, or otherwise offensive. We believe in the power of diverse voices and perspectives, but let's keep it civil, folks.</p>
    </h3>
<h2 class="white fw-600 fs-m3 mb-5">Termination</h2>
    <h3 class="indigo-lightest fw-600 fs-m1 opacity-50 my-5">
    <p>We reserve the right to terminate a user's access to our service at any time, for any reason. This could include violation of these terms of service, inappropriate conduct, or just a general feeling of being too cool for school. Don't worry, we'll give you plenty of notice before we break up with you.</p>
    </h3>

    <h2 class="white fw-600 fs-m3 mb-5">Feedback and Suggestions</h2>
    <h3 class="indigo-lightest fw-600 fs-m1 opacity-50 my-5">
    <p>We love hearing from our users! If you have any feedback or suggestions for how we can improve our service, we'd be happy to hear it. Just don't suggest that we stop encouraging people to read. That's like asking a fish to stop swimming - it just doesn't make sense.</p>
    </h3>
<h2 class="white fw-600 fs-m3 mb-5">Age Restriction</h2>
    <h3 class="indigo-lightest fw-600 fs-m1 opacity-50 my-5">
    <p>Our service is intended for users who are at least 13 years old. If you're under 13, please ask your parent or legal guardian to submit content on your behalf. We love young readers, but we want to make sure everyone is safe and compliant with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).</p>
    </h3>

    <h2 class="white fw-600 fs-m3 mb-5">Third-Party Links</h2>
    <h3 class="indigo-lightest fw-600 fs-m1 opacity-50 my-5">
    <p>We may include links to third-party websites or services on our site for your convenience or reference. However, we can't guarantee the safety or accuracy of these links, and we're not responsible for any content or actions on those third-party sites. As always, use your best judgement when clicking on links and be wary of any fishy business.</p>
    </h3>
    <h2 class="white fw-600 fs-m3 mb-5">Contact Us</h2>
    <h3 class="indigo-lightest fw-600 fs-m1 opacity-50 my-5">
